# CypherMed - Decentralized Medical Records Protocol

A blockchain-based healthcare platform built on Solana that gives patients true ownership and control over their medical records while providing hospitals, doctors, and insurers with secure, compliant, and fraud-proof access.

## 🎯 Overview

CypherMed leverages Solana's high-performance blockchain to create **immutable audit trails** of medical record access while keeping sensitive patient data encrypted in off-chain PostgreSQL databases. This hybrid approach ensures:

- **Patient Sovereignty**: Complete control over who accesses medical data
- **HIPAA Compliance**: Cryptographic proof of consent and access
- **Fraud Prevention**: Tamper-proof audit logs for insurers
- **Emergency Access**: Break-glass protocols for life-threatening situations
- **Interoperability**: Seamless data sharing between healthcare providers

---

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. **Patient-Controlled Access Management**
- Patients can grant and revoke access to specific healthcare providers
- Granular permissions for doctors, hospitals, and insurance companies
- Individual access control per provider (not institution-wide by default)
- Time-based access grants with automatic expiration
- Condition-based access rules per record type

### 2. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
- **Patient**: Full ownership and control of all medical records
- **Doctor**: View and create records with patient permission
- **Hospital**: Institutional access to patient records during treatment
- **Insurer**: Read-only access for claims verification
- **Emergency Responder**: Temporary emergency access with audit trail

### 3. **Immutable Audit Trail**
- Every access attempt is recorded on-chain (successful and failed)
- Timestamps for all record creation, modification, and access events
- Cryptographic proof of who accessed what and when
- Cannot be altered or deleted - permanent compliance record
- Real-time monitoring of unauthorized access attempts

### 4. **Emergency Access System**
- "Break-glass" access for life-threatening situations
- Emergency responders can access critical medical information
- All emergency access is logged with justification
- Post-emergency audit and review process
- Patient notification of emergency access

### 5. **Multi-Record Type Support**
- **General Medical Records**: Patient history, diagnoses, treatments
- **Prescriptions**: Medication history and current prescriptions
- **Lab Results**: Blood work, imaging, pathology reports
- **Visit Summaries**: Doctor's notes and consultation records
- **Immunization Records**: Vaccination history
- Each record type has customizable access rules

### 6. **Privacy-First Architecture**
- Sensitive medical data stored encrypted in off-chain PostgreSQL
- Only metadata, timestamps, and access logs stored on-chain
- Zero-knowledge proofs for verification without data exposure
- End-to-end encryption for all off-chain data
- Patient controls encryption keys

### 7. **Compliance & Verification**
- HIPAA-compliant audit trails
- Cryptographic proof of patient consent
- Fraud-proof verification for insurance claims
- Regulatory compliance automation
- Exportable audit logs for legal requirements

### 8. **Access Request System**
- Healthcare providers can request access from patients
- Patients approve/deny access requests
- Automated notifications for pending requests
- Batch approval for multiple providers
- Access history and statistics

### 9. **Lifetime Medical Records (Birth-to-Death)**
- **Birth Registration**: Hospital registers newborns with birth certificate
- **Guardian Management**: Parents control minor's records (auto-expires at 18)
- **Age-Based Transfer**: Automatic control handoff when patient turns 18
- **Family Linking**: Connect parent-child relationships for hereditary tracking
- **Permanent Record**: Never lose medical history from birth onward

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

### On-Chain (Solana)
- **Patient Accounts**: Identity and access control lists
- **Access Grants**: Permissions and expiration timestamps
- **Audit Logs**: Immutable record of all access events
- **Record Metadata**: Record IDs, types, timestamps, and hashes
- **Emergency Access**: Break-glass event logs

### Off-Chain (PostgreSQL)
- **Encrypted Medical Records**: Full patient medical data
- **IPFS/Arweave CIDs**: Pointers to distributed storage (future)
- **Encryption Keys**: Patient-controlled key management
- **Session Data**: Temporary access tokens

### Hybrid Benefits
✅ **Privacy**: Sensitive data never touches the blockchain  
✅ **Immutability**: Access logs cannot be tampered with  
✅ **Performance**: Fast queries on off-chain DB, verified on-chain  
✅ **Cost-Effective**: Only critical data incurs blockchain storage costs  
✅ **Scalability**: PostgreSQL handles high-volume medical data

## 🧭 Backend Local Development (Docker & Prisma)

We provide a Docker Compose file and Prisma setup to run a local Postgres instance for development and testing.

Why use Docker here:
- Reproducible local DB (same Postgres version across developers)
- Easy CI parity for migrations and integration tests

Quick start (from repository root):

```bash
# 1) Start local Postgres using the provided Compose file
cd backend
docker-compose up -d

# 2) Create the `.env` file used by Prisma
echo 'DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/cyphermed?schema=public"' > .env

# 3) Generate Prisma client and run migrations
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate dev --name init

# 4) Seed a test patient (script provided)
npm run prisma:seed

# 5) Stop containers when done
docker-compose down
```

Notes:
- The Compose file uses `postgres:15` and mounts a seed SQL file on first init. If your system has the legacy `docker-compose` binary, use `docker-compose` (we include support for that); otherwise `docker compose` works when the Docker Compose plugin is available.
- Prisma creates tables with model-casing (e.g., `"Patient"`). When querying directly with `psql`, quote identifiers or use the exact casing.

If you prefer not to run Docker locally, use a managed Postgres instance and set `DATABASE_URL` accordingly in `backend/.env`.


## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
anchor test

# Run specific test file
anchor test --skip-build tests/patient.test.ts

# Run with detailed logs
RUST_LOG=debug anchor test
```

## 📝 Usage Examples

### Initialize Patient Account
```rust
// Patient registers on the platform
initialize_patient(
    patient_wallet: Pubkey,
    name: String,
    date_of_birth: i64,
)
```

### Grant Access to Doctor
```rust
// Patient grants a doctor access to specific record types
grant_access(
    patient: Pubkey,
    provider: Pubkey,
    role: Role::Doctor,
    record_types: vec![RecordType::GeneralMedical, RecordType::LabResults],
    expiration: Some(timestamp + 30_days),
)
```

### Create Medical Record
```rust
// Doctor creates a new medical record
create_record(
    patient: Pubkey,
    provider: Pubkey,
    record_type: RecordType::Prescription,
    data_hash: String,      // Hash of encrypted off-chain data
    ipfs_cid: String,       // IPFS content identifier
)
```

### Emergency Access
```rust
// Emergency responder accesses patient records
emergency_access(
    responder: Pubkey,
    patient: Pubkey,
    justification: String,  // "Car accident, unconscious patient"
)
```

### Audit Access Logs
```rust
// Anyone can verify access history on-chain
get_audit_logs(
    patient: Pubkey,
    from_timestamp: i64,
    to_timestamp: i64,
)
```

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- **Private Keys**: Patients must securely store their Solana wallet keys
- **Off-Chain Security**: PostgreSQL must be properly secured and encrypted
- **Access Control**: All on-chain instructions verify permissions
- **Emergency Access**: Requires justification and creates permanent audit trail
- **Data Encryption**: All off-chain medical data is encrypted at rest
- **Transport Security**: TLS/SSL for all API communications
